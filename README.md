## Technology Stack

- Kotlin: The application is fully developed in Kotlin, ensuring a modern, concise, and safe codebase.

- MVVM Architecture: The code follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, allowing for a decoupled and easily testable codebase.

- Android Jetpack Compose: The UI is built using Jetpack Compose, the modern toolkit for building native UIs on Android, which allows for less boilerplate code and a powerful yet straightforward way to build interactive UIs.

- Hilt-Dagger: Dependency injection is handled by Hilt, making the code more modular and testing more convenient.

- Coil: For image loading, the project utilizes the power of Coil, making it easier to load, cache, and display images from various sources.
